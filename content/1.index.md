I'm Full Stack Developer and Animator from Alberta, Canada, working in web & app development. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

My job is to build your website so that it is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive.Moreover, I add personal touch to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use. My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way. I created web design for many famous brand companies.
